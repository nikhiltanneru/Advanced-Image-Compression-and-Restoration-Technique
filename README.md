# Advanced-Image-Compression-and-Restoration-Techniques

This repository contains the project files and codebase for the exploration of Advanced Image Compression and Restoration Techniques. The project focuses on enhancing compression efficiency and restoring high-quality images using both traditional methods and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

## Overview
#### Objectives
- To study and compare traditional, modern, and deep learning-based image compression methods.
- To implement restoration methods using GANs and Autoencoders.
- To evaluate performance on the DIV2K dataset with metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

#### Challenges
- Balancing compression efficiency, image quality, and computational complexity.
- Handling hardware and dataset limitations.

#### Proposed Solution
A model combining state-of-the-art compression formats (e.g., AVIF, WebP) with deep learning-based restoration techniques to improve image quality.
